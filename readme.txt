## Theme Development (Sass & Gulp & JavaScript)

Magaz is using Gulp to compile Sass and JavaScript.

First make sure you have Node.js npm installed, then run the the following commands in the Magaz theme directory to install npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

To start Gulp, run:

```
gulp
```

this will compile Sass files and start watching changes as you edit files.
